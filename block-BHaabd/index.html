     <p class="p3">The cat (Felis catus) is a domestic species of a small carnivorous mammal.
        It is the only domesticated species in
    the family Felidae and is often referred to as the domestic cat to distinguish it
     from the wild members of the
    family. A cat can either be a house cat, a farm cat or a feral cat; the latter 
    ranges freely and avoids human
    contact. Domestic cats are valued by humans for companionship and their ability
     to kill rodents. About 60 cat breeds
    are recognized by various cat registries.</p>
