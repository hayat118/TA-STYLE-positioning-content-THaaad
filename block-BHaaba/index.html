        <img class="img1" src="lion.jpeg">
        <P class="p1">The lion (Panthera leo) is a large cat of the genus Panthera native to Africa and India.
           It has a muscular, deep-chested
        body, short, rounded head, round ears, and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail.
         It is sexually dimorphic; adult male
        lions are larger than females and have a prominent mane. It is a social species,
         forming groups called prides. A lion's
        pride consists of a few adult males, related females, and cubs.</P>

        <h2>TIGER</h2>
        <img class="img2" src="tiger.jpeg">
        <p class="p2">The tiger (Panthera tigris) is the largest living cat species and a member of the
           genus Panthera. It is most
        recognisable for its dark vertical stripes on orange fur with a white underside.
         An apex predator, it primarily preys on
        ungulates such as deer and wild boar. It is territorial and generally a solitary but
         social predator, requiring large
        contiguous areas of habitat, which support its requirements for prey and rearing 
        of its offspring.</P>

        <h3>ELEPHANT</h3>
        <img class="img3" src="ele.jpeg">
        <P class="p3">Elephants are the largest existing land animals. Three living species are 
          currently recognised: the African bush
        elephant, the African forest elephant, and the Asian elephant. 
        They are an informal grouping within the proboscidean
        family Elephantidae. Elephantidae is the only surviving family of proboscideans;
         extinct members include the mastodons.
        Elephantidae also contains several extinct groups, including the mammoths and 
        straight-tusked elephants.</P>
