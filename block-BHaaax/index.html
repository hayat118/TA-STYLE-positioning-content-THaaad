        <h1>Mountain</h1>
        <p>A mountain is an elevated portion of the Earth's crust, generally with steep sides 
          that show significant exposed
        bedrock. A mountain differs from a plateau in having a limited summit area, and is
         larger than a hill, typically rising
        at least 300 metres (1000 feet) above the surrounding land. A few mountains are isolated 
        summits, but most occur in
        mountain ranges.
        
        Mountains are formed through tectonic forces, erosion, or volcanism, which act on time
         scales of up to tens of
        millions of years. Once mountain building ceases, mountains are slowly leveled through
         the action of weathering,
        through slumping and other forms of mass wasting, as well as through erosion by
         rivers and glaciers.</p>
